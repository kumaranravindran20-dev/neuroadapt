# NeuroAdapt

NeuroAdapt is a lightweight, brain-inspired adaptive neural network framework
designed for continuous online learning.

## Why NeuroAdapt?
Traditional ML models stop learning after training.
NeuroAdapt allows models to adapt continuously from new data.

## Installation
```bash
pip install neuroadapt
